# RULES.md

## Project: sheridanrichey.com

### Content Workflow
- All blog posts are stored in `/website/posts` as MDX files with standard multi-line YAML frontmatter.
- Contentlayer is the only content pipeline.
- Blog categories align with the ZAG Matrix: ZEN, ACT, GEM.
- All content must speak to "Alex, the Awakened Technologist" and reflect the ZAG Matrix philosophy.

### Deployment
- Platform: Vercel
- Production URL: https://sheridanrichey.com
- Deploy command: `vercel --prod`
- No preview/staging environment currently.
- No manual steps required; Vercel handles all deployments.
- See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for persistent deployment details.
- **Every production deployment must be preceded by a git commit and push with a clear, descriptive commit message.**

### Brand & Content Principles
- All content must connect to the ZAG Matrix (ZEN, ACT, GEM).
- Tone: Professional, confident, knowledgeable, approachable.
- Every page and post should have a clear purpose and call to action.

### PARA Method
- Project management and content categorization should follow PARA (Project, Area, Resource, Archive).
- Suggest PARA category and filename for all new content.
