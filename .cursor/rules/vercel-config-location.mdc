# Vercel Configuration Location Rule

## Critical: vercel.json Must Stay in Website Directory

**NEVER move `vercel.json` to the root directory of this monorepo.**

### Correct Location
- `vercel.json` should always be located at: `[website/vercel.json](mdc:website/vercel.json)`
- This is the correct location for the Next.js application in this monorepo structure

### Why This Matters
- The Vercel project is configured with Root Directory set to `website`
- Moving `vercel.json` to the root causes deployment conflicts
- The root directory contains other project files that are not part of the web application

### What to Do Instead
- If `vercel.json` needs to be created or modified, always place it in the `website/` directory
- If you find `vercel.json` in the root directory, move it to `website/vercel.json`
- The Vercel dashboard settings (Root Directory: `website`) handle the monorepo configuration

### Related Files
- [website/vercel.json](mdc:website/vercel.json) - The correct location for Vercel configuration
- [website/next.config.js](mdc:website/next.config.js) - Next.js configuration
- [website/package.json](mdc:website/package.json) - Application dependencies

### Deployment Context
- Vercel is configured to use `website` as the root directory
- Static files are served from `website/public/`
- Build commands run from within the `website/` directory
