# CI/CD & Deployment Workflow

## Deployment Strategy
- **Primary Method**: Git-based deployment (GitOps)
- **Platform**: Vercel for hosting and automatic deployments
- **Trigger**: `git push origin main` to main branch
- **Fallback**: Manual deployment via Vercel CLI

## GitOps Workflow
1. **Development**: Make changes locally
2. **Staging**: Stage and commit changes with descriptive messages
3. **Deployment**: Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
4. **Verification**: Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
5. **Testing**: Verify functionality on production site

## Deployment Scripts
- [deploy.ps1](mdc:website/deploy.ps1) - PowerShell deployment helper
- Provides guidance for Git-based deployment
- Assists with commit message formatting
- Helps with deployment verification

## Environment Management
- **Development**: Local development server
- **Preview**: Vercel preview deployments for PRs
- **Production**: Main branch deployments
- **Environment Variables**: Managed in Vercel dashboard

## Testing Integration
- **Pre-deployment**: Run E2E tests locally
- **Post-deployment**: Verify critical functionality
- **Continuous Testing**: Test on every deployment
- **Test Reports**: Generated and stored for review

## Quality Gates
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript compilation
- **Testing**: E2E test suite passes
- **Build**: Next.js build successful
- **Deployment**: Vercel deployment successful
- **Verification**: Production functionality verified

## Rollback Strategy
- **Immediate**: Revert to previous commit
- **Hotfix**: Quick fixes for critical issues
- **Full Rollback**: Complete deployment reversal
- **Documentation**: Track all rollback decisions

## Monitoring & Alerts
- **Deployment Status**: Vercel dashboard monitoring
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals tracking
- **Errors**: Error monitoring and alerting
- **Uptime**: Site availability monitoring
