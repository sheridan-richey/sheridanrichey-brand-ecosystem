# CI/CD Workflow Standards

## GitHub Actions Workflow
- E2E testing workflow: [.github/workflows/playwright.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/playwright.yml)
- Triggers on pull requests to `main` branch
- Manual trigger available via `workflow_dispatch`
- Runs Playwright tests against production site

## Vercel Deployment
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Production URL: https://sheridanrichey.com
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Environment variables managed via Vercel dashboard

## Required Secrets
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Vercel API token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Team ID (team_SXzIcySViXy1FSCVMJ9Si9pE)
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Project ID (prj_Z0L8peVOikrqGnjPmTq023GFz4Kh)

## Testing Strategy
- E2E tests run against production site
- No preview deployment testing (build issues resolved separately)
- Tests focus on navigation and page loading
- Form testing excluded until forms are wired up

## Deployment Process
1. Code changes pushed to feature branch
2. Pull request created to `main`
3. GitHub Actions triggers E2E tests
4. Tests run against production site
5. Vercel automatically deploys on merge to `main`

## Quality Gates
- All E2E tests must pass before merge
- No 404 errors on main navigation pages
- Blog functionality must work
- Basic page loading validation

## Rollback Strategy
- Vercel provides automatic rollback capabilities
- Previous deployments available in Vercel dashboard
- Can manually trigger rollback if needed

## Monitoring
- Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring
- GitHub Actions logs for test results
- Production site monitoring via Vercel

## Best Practices
- Always test locally before pushing
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep pull requests focused and small
- Monitor test results in GitHub Actions
