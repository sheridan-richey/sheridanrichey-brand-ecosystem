# Strategic Career Moves That Compound Success
In the ZAG Matrix framework, GEM (Growth Earns Mastery) represents the phase where you apply your accumulated zeal and energy toward strategic decisions that create compounding returns. Your career moves in this phase aren't just about the next job—they're about building a foundation for exponential growth.
## The Compounding Career Principle
Most professionals think about career moves linearly: better title, more money, bigger company. But the most successful people I've worked with—and the most successful moves I've made—follow a compounding principle: each decision should make the next decision easier and more impactful.
### What Makes a Career Move Strategic?
A strategic career move isn't just about immediate benefits. It's about positioning yourself for future opportunities that don't even exist yet. These moves typically have three characteristics:
1. **Skill Multiplication** - Builds capabilities that open multiple future doors
2. **Network Expansion** - Connects you to people who can accelerate your growth
3. **Reputation Building** - Creates a personal brand that precedes you
## My Strategic Career Journey
### The Move That Changed Everything: AdvancedMD
When I joined AdvancedMD, I wasn't just taking a job—I was positioning myself in the healthcare technology space, which was about to explode. But more importantly, I was joining a company that would teach me about scaling products and leading teams.
**Key Lesson**: Look for industries and companies that are on the cusp of growth, not just those that are already successful.
### The Calculated Risk: SirsiDynix
Moving to SirsiDynix was a calculated risk. The company was smaller than AdvancedMD, but it offered me the opportunity to lead product development and work directly with the CEO. This move wasn't about the immediate role—it was about building executive-level experience.
**Key Lesson**: Sometimes a lateral or even backward move in title can be a forward move in experience and responsibility.
### The Industry Pivot: Extensiv
Joining Extensiv represented a strategic pivot into the logistics and supply chain space. This wasn't just a career move—it was an industry move that would later position me perfectly for the e-commerce boom and the supply chain challenges that followed.
**Key Lesson**: Industry expertise can be as valuable as functional expertise. Don't be afraid to pivot into growing sectors.
### The Leadership Leap: Henry Schein One
My move to Henry Schein One was about stepping into a larger stage. It wasn't just about the company size—it was about the opportunity to lead larger teams, manage more complex products, and work in a more regulated industry.
**Key Lesson**: Each career move should increase your scope of responsibility and complexity of challenges.

## Red Flags: When a Move Isn't Strategic
### Avoid These Career Moves:
1. **The Money Trap** - Taking a role just for higher salary without growth potential
2. **The Title Chase** - Moving for a better title without increased responsibility
3. **The Comfort Zone** - Staying in a role that doesn't challenge you
4. **The Desperation Move** - Taking any job because you're unhappy in current role
5. **The Bandwagon Jump** - Following trends without considering your unique value
## Building Your Strategic Career Plan
### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-5)

- Build relationships and reputation
- Identify your unique value proposition
### Phase 2: Strategic Positioning (Years 5-10)

### Phase 3: Compounding Growth (Years 10+)

## Your Next Strategic Move
Think about your current situation and ask:
1. **What's my next logical move?** (The safe choice)
2. **What's my strategic move?** (The growth choice)
3. **What's my transformational move?** (The breakthrough choice)
The difference between incremental career growth and exponential success often comes down to making strategic moves that compound over time. In the GEM phase of your ZAG Matrix journey, every career decision should be evaluated not just for its immediate impact, but for how it positions you for future opportunities.
## Remember: Career Moves Are Investments
Your career moves are investments in your future. Like any investment, they should be evaluated based on:
- **Risk vs. Reward** - What are you giving up vs. what you're gaining?
- **Time Horizon** - How long will it take to see returns?
- **Compounding Potential** - Will this create opportunities for future growth?
The most successful professionals don't just make good career moves—they make moves that create a foundation for future moves. Each decision builds on the last, creating a compounding effect that leads to exponential growth.
