### **Rubik's Cube ZAG Matrix Prompt:**
```
Transform the ZAG Matrix into a 3D Rubik's cube visualization:

CURRENT: 3x3 flat grid with colored squares
DESIRED: 3D Rubik's cube with individual cubies

REQUIREMENTS:
- 3D perspective showing cube depth
- Individual cubies with black grid lines between them
- Rounded corners on each cubie
- Shadows and highlights for depth
- Letters Z, A, G, E, C, T, N, M on cube faces
- Colors: Purple (ZEN), Teal #279595 (ACT), Brown/Orange (GEM)
- "ZAG" letters highlighted or elevated
- Thematic words below: "Clarity," "Momentum," "Mastery"

METAPHOR: Like solving a Rubik's cube, the ZAG Matrix shows how interconnected elements can be transformed into alignment.

Make it look like a real, physical Rubik's cube that represents the interconnected nature of ZEN, ACT, and GEM.
