## 2.0 Brand Logo

### 2.1 Lockup Logo
The Lockup logo refers to the design featuring the "SR" monogram and the "SHERIDAN RICHEY" wordmark locked together. This is the primary logo and involves the combination of the graphic icon and text, arranged in a fixed way to cohesively convey the brand's identity.

**Primary Lockup**: SR | SHERIDAN RICHEY

### 2.2 Monogram (Logo Mark)
The "SR" monogram is the graphic element or symbol that represents the brand. It is a custom-designed icon that carries the brand's identity and can be used in contexts where the full lockup is not appropriate.

### 2.3 Clearspace
Clearspace is the specific amount of space that a logo must have on all sides, no matter where it is used. The reason for clearspace is to ensure that a logo maximizes visibility and impact. Maintaining proper clearspace helps ensure the logo looks professional and doesn't lose its visual impact in crowded designs.
