# Image Path Resolution Fixes - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-07-27  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Category:** 4A - Technical Maintenance

## Problem Identified
The website had image path resolution issues where images were being referenced with relative paths (`./image.jpg`) instead of the correct Next.js public directory paths (`/image.jpg`). This was causing images to not load properly in the browser.

## Files Fixed

### 1. HeroSection.tsx
- **Issue:** `src="./sheridan-headshot.jpg"`
- **Fix:** `src="/sheridan-headshot.jpg"`

### 2. newsletter/page.tsx
- **Issue:** `src="./sheridan-blog.jpg"`
- **Fix:** `src="/sheridan-blog.jpg"`

### 3. contact/page.tsx
- **Issue:** `src="./sheridan-contact.jpg"`
- **Fix:** `src="/sheridan-contact.jpg"`

### 4. blog/page.tsx
- **Issue:** `src="./sheridan-blog.jpg"`
- **Fix:** `src="/sheridan-blog.jpg"`

### 5. about/page.tsx
- **Issue:** `src="./sheridan-about.jpg"`
- **Fix:** `src="/sheridan-about.jpg"`

## Verification
- ✅ All image files exist in `/website/public/` directory
- ✅ All SVG assets referenced in `/assets/` directories exist
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no image-related errors
- ✅ All pages generated properly in production build

## Technical Details
In Next.js, images in the `public` directory must be referenced with a leading slash `/` to indicate they're served from the public directory root. Relative paths (`./`) don't work correctly in this context.

## Impact
- Images now load properly across all pages
- Improved user experience with visual content
- Maintained brand consistency with proper headshot display
- No build errors related to missing assets

## Next Steps
- Monitor image loading in production deployment
- Consider implementing Next.js Image component for optimization
- Add image optimization and lazy loading for better performance
