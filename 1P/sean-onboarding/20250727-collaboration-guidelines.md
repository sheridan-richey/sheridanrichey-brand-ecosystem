# Collaboration Guidelines for Sean Hokanson

## üéØ **Overview**
This document outlines the collaboration standards, workflows, and expectations for working on the Sheridan Richey Brand Ecosystem project. This is a **flexible, ad-hoc collaboration** designed for off-hours work with no fixed schedules or urgent deadlines.

## üîÑ **Git Workflow**

### **Branch Strategy**
- **main**: Primary development branch (protected)
- **feature/[name]**: New features and enhancements
- **fix/[name]**: Bug fixes and corrections
- **docs/[name]**: Documentation updates

### **Commit Message Standards**
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(website): add new ZAG Matrix component
fix(blog): resolve MDX rendering issue
docs(setup): update environment variables guide
style(components): improve button styling
refactor(automation): simplify Slack channel creation
```

### **Pull Request Process**
1. **Create feature branch** from main
2. **Make focused changes** (one feature per PR)
3. **Write descriptive PR title** and description
4. **Request review** from Sheridan
5. **Address feedback** and iterate
6. **Merge** after approval

## üé® **Code Standards**

### **TypeScript & React**
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use proper type definitions
- Follow Next.js 13+ App Router patterns

### **Styling**
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use brand colors from the design system

### **File Organization**
- Components in `/website/components/`
- Pages in `/website/app/`
- Blog posts in `/website/posts/`
- Content in `/content/` directory
- Tests in `/tests/` directory

### **Naming Conventions**
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `ZagMatrixSidebar.tsx`)
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `zag-matrix-page.tsx`)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `handleNewsletterSignup`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `ZAG_MATRIX_PILLARS`)

## üè∑Ô∏è **Brand Consistency**

### **ZAG Matrix Framework**
Every piece of content must connect to the ZAG Matrix:
- **ZEN (Zeal Evolves Now)**: Mental clarity, purpose, resilience
- **ACT (Activate Core Thrust)**: Physical well-being, relationships, momentum
- **GEM (Growth Earns Mastery)**: Strategic growth, investments, entrepreneurship

### **Target Audience**
All content serves "Alex, the Awakened Technologist":
- Mid-career professional
- Achieved success but seeking greater purpose
- Interested in holistic well-being and entrepreneurial growth

### **Tone & Voice**
- Professional but approachable
- Confident and knowledgeable
- Focus on actionable insights
- Include specific examples from Sheridan's career

## üìû **Communication Protocols**

### **Asynchronous Communication**
- **Email** for longer-form updates and planning (primary)
- **GitHub Issues/PRs** for code-related discussions and progress tracking
- **Slack DM** for quick questions when both online (secondary)
- **No scheduled meetings** - we'll communicate when it fits our schedules

### **Response Expectations**
- **Email**: 24-48 hour response time (best effort)
- **GitHub Issues**: Address within a few days when working on the project
- **Slack**: When online and available (no pressure for immediate response)
- **No urgent deadlines** - this is a flexible, low-pressure collaboration

### **Emergency Contact**
- **Email**: sheridan@sheridanrichey.com (primary)
- **Phone**: 801.518.2714 (only for critical technical issues)
- **GitHub**: @sheridan-richey (for project discussions)

## üß™ **Testing Requirements**

## üìã **Project Management**

- **Brand consistency** in deliverables
- **Clear communication** via GitHub and email
- **Sustainable, low-pressure collaboration** rhythm

## üöÄ **Development Workflow**

5. **Update via email or GitHub Issues** when you have updates to share

### **No Fixed Schedule**
